# Exact and approximate algorithms for counting triangles and other graphlets


## motivation

- counting triangles is a fundamental problem in graph theory
- some problems requre exact algorithms
- exact algorithms are needed to evaluate approximate algorithms
- explore possible generalizations of triangles counting algorithms to other graphlets


## methods

- start by implementing algortihms seen in class
- look for euristic optimizations, still giving exact results
- (?) implement approximate algorithms
- compare running times across graphs of different sizes
- explore possible generalizations to other graphlets


## intended experiments

- use graphs from `https://networkrepository.com/`
    - choose graphs spanning different orders of magnitude in size
- implement algorithms from scratch (C++)
    - use pseudocode from class as a guide for known algorithms
- machine for experiments: personal laptop
